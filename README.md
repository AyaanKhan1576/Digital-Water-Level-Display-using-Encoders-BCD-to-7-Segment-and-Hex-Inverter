# Digital Water Level Display using Encoders, BCD to 7 Segment, and Hex Inverter

Physical Implementation of the project was carried out and secured full marks as part of Digital Logic Design Course at FAST NUCES Islamabad

This project demonstrates a digital water level indicator system designed using hardware components and simulated using Proteus. The system uses encoders, BCD to 7-segment decoders, and hex inverters to measure and display the water level in a tank.

## Features

- **Real-time water level display** on a 7-segment display.
- **Proteus simulation** files included for easy testing and visualization.
- **Hardware implementation** successfully built and tested.

## Project Overview

- **Input:** Water level sensors (such as float switches or probes) detect the current water level.
- **Encoder:** Converts sensor signals into BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) format.
- **BCD to 7-Segment Decoder:** Translates BCD output to a format suitable for 7-segment displays.
- **Hex Inverter:** Used for signal conditioning and logic inversion as required by the circuit.
- **Output:** The current water level is shown as a digit on the 7-segment display.


## Results

- The design was physically implemented and secured full marks.
- The Proteus simulation accurately reflects the hardware behavior.
